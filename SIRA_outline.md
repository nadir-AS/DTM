# SIRA - Survey for Inclusive Rapid Assessment

## 1. What is SIRA

SIRA is a digital data collection tool consisting of household and individual questionnaires aimed at identifying the barriers and enablers that persons with disabilities and older adults face in accessing humanitarian assistance.  

* The household questionnaire focuses on demographic information such as the characteristics of the household head, household size, and displacement status.
* The individual questionnaire covers additional socio-demographic characteristics - including health status, education level, and income - as well as the Washington Group Questions and inquiries about the barriers and enablers experienced.

Although SIRA was initially designed to survey both persons with and without disabilities across all age groups, it can also be deployed with specific target groups, such as older adults only. SIRA has been extensively tested in Mozambique in 2025 using two-stage stratified sampling as well as during focus group discussions.

Accurate data on both the number of persons with disabilities in need of humanitarian assistance, and their specific needs, is rarely available for most humanitarian contexts worldwide. Similarly, older persons also face specific needs, for example in relation to disability (IASC, 2019) and chronic disease (Duault, *et al.,* 2018; Karunakara, 2015).

SIRA was developed as part of the Elrha(FCDO)-funded Data that Matters project by Light for the World and FAMOD -Mozambican national umbrella OPD. SIRA's aim is to generate evidence for age- and disability-inclusive humanitarian programming and advocacy.  


## 2. A mixed Methods data collection tool

SIRA combines both quantitative and qualitative elements. The quantitative parts of the questionnaire cover i) household and individual demographic and socio-economic characteristics and ii) individual responses to the Washington Group set of questions and Child Functioning Module, assessing the following functional domains: vision, hearing, movement, cognition, anxiety, depression, pain and fatigue. The qualitative parts of the survey consists of structured, semi-structured and open-ended questions on the barriers and enablers faced by respondents in accessing humanitarian assistance. Survey respondents will be selected based on a two-stage stratified random cluster sampling

## 4. Digital Questionnaire 

The digital questionnaire was developed in [ActivityInfo][https://www.activityinfo.org/c/c714p9ilm0u2srt26o/d39a06] and subsequently ported to [Kobo][https://eu.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms/a8RZo34RjzEqEuywMiBvqx]. The digital surveys can be accessed by following the respective links. The blueprint for re-creating SIRA are also provided here as tables for subsequent conversion to .xlsx (ActivityInfo) or .xlsx (Kobo) files.


## 5. Data Analysis

Ultimately the data analysis needs will depend on the surveying organisation and any changes made to SIRA to adapt it to specific requirements. The data generated through the pilot testing of SIRA in Cabo Delagdo, Mozambique in 2025 as part of the Data that Matters project can be found on UN OCHA's [Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)][https://data.humdata.org/dataset/sira-disability-and-older-age-dataset-metuge-and-pemba-cabo-delgado-mozambique-may-2024]

Similarly, [an interactive data analysis dashboard][https://n-merlaint.shinyapps.io/Analysis_Dashboard/] was developed as part of the Data that Matters project. The R shiny code is provided as part of this GitHub repository.
